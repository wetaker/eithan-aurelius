What data are we interested in?

# A simplistic way 
data[user] = {
    channel1: timeInChannel
    channel2: timeInChannel
}

# More insights if we just log every voiceState
data[user] = {
    date1: {
        channel1: timeInChannel1
        channel2: timeInChannel2
    }
}

# In the more extreme case we could just log every voiceState change
# Say we had a user for 2 years moving 40 channels a day => 28,000 
data[user] = [all voiceState events ever]


# Approach 2 seems closest to the level of detail we are interested in.

How can we realize this approach?

# Getting the data
We are interested in if a user leaves the server of changes to a different channel => time in that channel needs to be updated
Compute time with t = newstate.time - oldstate.time

Unfortunately we are not provided with the time of the voiceState update so we will have to maintain it ourselves
Maintain dict[user_id] = old_time
    user moves to new channel => compute time, set dict[user_id] = cur_time
    user leaves server => compute time, del dict[user_id]


# Storing the data
For every voiceState update => contact DB and update channel time for that user



schema

channel_sessions
{user_id, duration, date, channel_id}

user_channel_connection
{user_id, channel_id, duration}
